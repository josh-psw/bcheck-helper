# BCheck Helper
This extension provides a quick way to view and download BChecks in any given GitHub repository. 
By default, this is `portswigger/bchecks`, which you can find [here](https://github.com/portswigger/bchecks).

You can also submit new BChecks to a repository. This will commit and push the file, and raise a pull request. You'll 
need to configure a GitHub API key to do this.

Using this extension, you can also copy the contents of the BCheck so that you can import them using the BCheck editor,
and you can save them to a directory on your machine.

If you'd like to find out more about BChecks, you can view our documentation [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/automated-scanning/bchecks).
